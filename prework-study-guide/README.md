Repo for coding bootcamp. 

# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This project will be a place to organize amd store information about the prework content. My motivation was to have an organized and easy to use study guide for the bootcamp. I built this in order to practice new skills. It solved the problem of not having my prework notes in an organized place. I learned a lot about the topics listed above!
